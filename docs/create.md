So you want to create content which can be injected into the game! Currently we allow you to create the following kinds of things:

* Characters (with Decks)
* Cards (Monsters, Locations)
* Actions (Spells and Attacks performed by Cards)
* Events (Generated by Cards and give the player choices or change the battlefield)

If you're creating a Character, just look at the Character section and then the subsection on Avatars. If you're creating a card, first read the sections on Characters and Monster Cards (or just Location cards).. then read the sections on Actions and Events for adding capabilities to the card

We build the characters using JSON-LD. Start with this template:

```json
{
    "@context": {
        "n": "http://www.w3.org/2006/vcard/ns#",
        "foaf": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/",
        "mud": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Multi-User-Domain/vocab/main/mud#",
        "mudchar": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Multi-User-Domain/vocab/main/mudchar.ttl#",
        "mudcard": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Multi-User-Domain/vocab/main/mudcard.ttl#",
        "mudcombat": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Multi-User-Domain/vocab/main/mudcombat.ttl#",
        "mudworld": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Multi-User-Domain/vocab/main/mudworld.ttl#",
        "twt2023": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Multi-User-Domain/vocab/main/games/twt2023.ttl#",
        "dcterms": "http://purl.org/dc/terms/"
    }
}
```

Add an `@id` which is the URL where the JSON object will be published (e.g. if it's going on the MongoDB server then it will end up with something like `"https://api.realm.games.coop/cards/something-unique/"`)

Optionally add:
* Creator (`dcterms:creator`): string, a URL representing you

# Characters

Characters can be used as both Avatars and as Monster Cards. Common properties of both roles are outlined first in this section, then see the subsections for specific detail

These properties are always used:

* Name (`n:fn`): string
* Description (`n:hasNote`): string 
* Image (`foaf:depiction`): Built-in content generated using https://app.artflow.ai/image-studio, but any 512x512 image is fine

Add `"@type": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Multi-User-Domain/vocab/main/mudchar.ttl#Character"`

## Characters (Avatars)

The following properties are required:

* Starting deck (`mudcard:hasDeck`): an array of cards. The card objects can be in full, using this guide, or can be copy-pasted from existing cards (TODO: allow for id-only cards to make this easier). Template below

```json
{
    "mudcard:hasDeck": {
        "mudcard:hasCards": [

        ]
    }
}
```

The following properties are optional:

* Starting Region (`twt2023:lordOfRegion`): this comes from mudworld and is quite open-ended, you might need my help with it depending on what you want to do. Example below

```json
{
    "twt2023:lordOfRegion": {
        "@id": "_:OspreyWithersStartingRegion",
        "@type": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Multi-User-Domain/vocab/main/mudworld.ttl#Region",
        "n:fn": "The Deadlands",
        "mudworld:hasRegions": [
            {
                "@id": "_:WitheringHeights",
                "@type": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Multi-User-Domain/vocab/main/mudworld.ttl#Region",
                "mudworld:hasPopulations": [
                    {
                        "@id": "_:WitheringHeightsHumanPopulation",
                        "mudworld:populationNumber": 6,
                        "mud:species": {
                            "@id": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Multi-User-Domain/vocab/main/mud.ttl#Human"
                        }
                    }
                ],
                "n:fn": "Withering Heights",
                "n:hasNote": "The scant villagers who live here live under constant fear of their master's cruelty"
            },
            {
                "@id": "_:WithersManor",
                "@type": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Multi-User-Domain/vocab/main/mudworld.ttl#Region",
                "mudworld:hasPopulations": [],
                "n:fn": "Withers Manor",
                "n:hasNote": "The lair of the Vampire Lord of the Deadlands"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

## Characters (Monster Cards)

The following properties are optional:

* Health Points (`mudcombat:hasHealthPoints`): The server will by default generate hit points at 10 HP for the character. Example custom hit points below

```json
{
    "mudcombat:hasHealthPoints": {
        "@type": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Multi-User-Domain/vocab/main/mudcombat.ttl#HealthPoints",
        "mudcombat:maximumP": 10,
        "mudcombat:currentP": 10
    }
}
```
